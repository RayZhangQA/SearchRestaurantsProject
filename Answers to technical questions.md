### How long did you spend on the technical test?

	3.5 hours


### What would you add to your solution if you had more time? 

	1. Add Extent Reports to get more user friendly reports
	2. Integrate with Jenkins to schedule the execution and select the different browsers by creating the build in Jenkins.
	3. Add mobile devices automation suites to validate the functions on iOS and Android devices because this kind of apps are more popular on mobile devices. 

### If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

	1. More detailed comments in the code.
	2. Add capturing screenshots while the test case failed.
	3. Create more test cases to validate the search functions, such as some negative test cases.
	4. Add more testNG.xml files to run different combinations of the test cases, such as prioritizing the test cases, grouping and parallel execution. 
	5. Optimizing the code.  

	Notes: My old personal laptop has problem with Python editor currently. so I used Java instead of Python.

### What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

Personally, I am more interested in Continuous testing. Generally the Continuous testing starts at the beginning. Each milestone along the way serves as a quality gate, baking in excellence at each stage of the software development process. As each phase clears, more testing happens as needed. Implementing continuous testing methodologies is already the biggest trend in test automation, but some organizations that embark on their DevOps journeys struggle with it.

### How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

	1. Ask the customers to prioritize the critical areas of the app
	2. Write manual regression test scripts for each area
	3. Budget time in each sprint to write GUI smoke tests for those areas
	4. Execute the test suite at least once a day with the CI framework
	5. All new development should have adequate tests

	Did once few years ago. The biggest challenge was update the manual test cases. Once the test cases were updated and modified based on the automated framework structure the rest was very easy. 

### How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?

	1. Add more languages for the convenience of non-English people. 
	2. The Login should allow user to login with more popular social accounts, such as, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, and etc. Looks like currently only support Facebook.
	3. Integrated with real time status updates of the delivery. e.g. integrate with Google maps that can show the path delivery moving to the customer's location. With this integration, the customer knows where their delivery goes so they get the idea how long the delivery will be coming. In case the delivery goes to a wrong address, the customer can find this problem earlier and correct it in advance.
